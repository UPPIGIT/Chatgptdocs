I have to prepare document for my data load process. I have implemented multiple dags. I will explain each dag high level. Can you write documentation for me pls
ChatGPT
Sure, I'd be happy to help with that. To create comprehensive documentation for your data load process and the DAGs you've implemented, I'll need some details about each DAG, including:

DAG Name: The name of the DAG.
Purpose: The main goal or purpose of the DAG.
Schedule: How often the DAG runs (e.g., daily, hourly, on-demand).
Tasks: The tasks included in the DAG, with a brief description of each.
Dependencies: Any dependencies between tasks within the DAG.
Data Sources: The data sources the DAG interacts with.
Outputs: The expected outputs or results of the DAG.
Error Handling: Any error handling or retry logic implemented.
Notifications: Notification mechanisms for success/failure.
Once you provide these details, I'll be able to draft a detailed documentation for you.





1.START_LOAD_DAG.
This DAG is starting point. This DAG contains multiple other dags trigger based on conditions
ChatGPT
Great, let's start with the documentation for the START_LOAD_DAG. Please provide the following additional details for a comprehensive document:

Schedule: How often does the START_LOAD_DAG run?
Tasks: Brief descriptions of the tasks involved.
Conditions: The conditions under which each sub-DAG is triggered.
Dependencies: Any dependencies between tasks within this DAG.
Data Sources: Any data sources it interacts with.
Outputs: Expected outputs or results.
Error Handling: Error handling or retry logic implemented.
Notifications: Notification mechanisms for success/failure.
Once I have this information, I can create a detailed documentation section for the START_LOAD_DAG.





No it is base dag. It will trigger different dags
ChatGPT
Got it. Here's a draft documentation for the START_LOAD_DAG based on your initial description.

START_LOAD_DAG Documentation
Overview
The START_LOAD_DAG serves as the entry point for our data load process. It orchestrates the execution of multiple downstream DAGs based on predefined conditions.

Purpose
The primary goal of the START_LOAD_DAG is to initiate various data processing workflows by triggering other DAGs conditionally.

Schedule
Frequency: [Specify the schedule, e.g., daily, hourly, etc.]
Tasks
Check Conditions: This task evaluates the conditions to determine which downstream DAGs should be triggered.
Trigger DAG A: This task triggers DAG_A if condition X is met.
Trigger DAG B: This task triggers DAG_B if condition Y is met.
Trigger DAG C: This task triggers DAG_C if condition Z is met.
Conditions
Condition X: [Description of the condition for triggering DAG_A]
Condition Y: [Description of the condition for triggering DAG_B]
Condition Z: [Description of the condition for triggering DAG_C]
Dependencies
The tasks within the START_LOAD_DAG are sequentially dependent:

Check Conditions -> Trigger DAG A
Check Conditions -> Trigger DAG B
Check Conditions -> Trigger DAG C
Data Sources
Data Source 1: [Description]
Data Source 2: [Description]
Outputs
The primary output of the START_LOAD_DAG is the triggering of the appropriate downstream DAGs based on the evaluated conditions.

Error Handling
Retries: Each task is configured with a retry mechanism to handle transient failures.
Alerts: In case of failures, alerts are sent to the responsible team via email and monitoring dashboards.
Notifications
Success: A success notification is sent when all tasks complete successfully.
Failure: A failure notification is sent if any task fails after all retry attempts.
Please fill in any specific details that are currently placeholders (like schedule, data sources, and conditions). Once you provide that information, I can refine the document further.
